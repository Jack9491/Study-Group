# 🎓 Study-Group

**Study-Group** is an application developed by **Cillian Ferguson and myself** during Semester 2 of Year 2 for the **Applications Development and Design Module**. This project marked my first experience working in a group, and I was thrilled with the final result.

This application, built using **C#**, **Visual Studio**, and **WinForms**, allows students to create and manage study sessions for their group projects, while also analyzing student demographics and room availability.
